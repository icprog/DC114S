  @par Demo Description 
This demo shows:  
    - how to run MiCO system based on a hello world applicaiton program. 
      Include the following specifical function:
       - how to Print logs through MiCO UART2(system debug serial port of MiCO);
       - how to flip a LED(connected to MiCO GPIO) ON or OFF  status by calling MiCO API;
       - how to Hang up the current thread for a while by calling MiCO API.

    - MiCO UART2 is mapping to UARTx of MCU, which can refer to platform.c and paltform.h.
    - MICO_SYS_LED is mapping to a GPIO, which can refer to platform.c and paltform.h.

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain, 
    - IDE:  IAR 7.30.4 or Keil MDK 5.13.       
    - Debugging Tools: JLINK or STLINK
 - Modify header file path of  "mico_config.h".   Please referring to "http://mico.io/wiki/doku.php?id=confighchange"
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.   Please referring to "http://mico.io/wiki/doku.php?id=debug"
 - Run the demo.
 - View operating results and system serial log (Serial port: Baud rate: 115200, data bits: 8bit, parity: No, stop bits: 1).   Please referring to http://mico.io/wiki/doku.php?id=com.mxchip.basic
